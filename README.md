# Data-Professional-Survey
The survey dashboard project is a data visualization and analysis that displays the results of a survey conducted among data professionals.
The purpose of the dashboard is to explore the demographics, preferences, challenges, and satisfaction levels of data professionals across different countries and job titles.
The goals of the dashboard are to provide insights into the data profession, identify trends and patterns, and support decision-making for data-related careers and education.
The survey data was collected from an online platform that invited data professionals to participate in a 10-minute questionnaire. This was followed by data preparation and data cleaning, checking for missing values, outliers and adding new variables based on existing one.
After that I made this interactive dashboard in Microsoft Power BI highlighting different insights.
